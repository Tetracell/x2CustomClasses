This file lists (A-Z) all ther perks you can (might be able to) use from the DLC (Alien Hunters & Shens Last Gift)
Abilities that require specific perks or weapons are listed in the A-Z list but notes are added to say if they require the weapon or not.
Note that I'm not 100% sure if all these abilities will work, I don't really use them as I prefer to earn them
